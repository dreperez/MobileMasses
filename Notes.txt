Vanilla MVC3 Issues (Slide)

You Can Make Things Better (Slide)

If you do nothing... (Slide)

...at least add a viewport meta tag (slide)
	-  Add viewport meta tag to _layout.chtml
	-  Show site in WP7 emulator
	-  Show site in Android emulator
	-  Show site in iOS emulator (same)
	
There is a lot more you can do (Slide)

But we don't have to ... (Slide)

MVC4: Mobile Specific Features (Slide)
	
Mobile project template (Slide)
	- File -> New Project
	- MVC4
	- Next
	- Notice 2 new options "Empty" and "Mobile"
	- Select Mobile
	- Show site.Css is bare
	- Show it includes jQuery Mobile (scripts and CSS)
	- View on mobile emulators
	- How cool is that!
	- If only we created mobile only sites! :)

Of course we don't create Mobile Only (JUST SAY)

Spin up new MVC4 site
	- talk a little about the new template
	- Haack and the boys actually had a designer's input - looks Purdy
	- columns
	- Twitter/Facebook
	- overall more pleasing to the eye, but who uses the default template anyway!?
		
Enhancements for adaptive rendering (Slide)
	- show viewport tag in _Layout
	- show mobile styles that use Media Queries (search @media)
	- spin up site and make smaller to show adaptiveness
	- spin up default site in mobile browsers

Display Modes (Slide)
	- Go through slide
	- Show implementation of iPhone Display Mode
	
Dial it up to 11 (Slide)
	
jQuery.Mobile (Slide)
	- **** Note on HTML5 markup-driven configuration
				- Don't have to worry about a mobile browser not being up to par with the
				rest for the HTML 5 features...based on universally adopted standards.
	- Talk a bit about progressive enhancements and graceful degradation
	- Accessibility features, very important now mobile devices are the norm!
	- Install in default project (package-install jquery.mobile)
	- Note what it installed
		- images
		- couple of css files
		- scripts
	- Run it
		- No change on desktop
		- No change on Mobile either
	- Not Hooked Up because Nuget package just dumps the files.
	- So I could manually hook up everything or I could use jQuery.Mobile.MVC
	
jQuery.Mobile.MVC
	- install via NuGet
	- *** Make sure version of jQuery and jQuery mobile in _layout.mobile match installed versions
	- Show the new items
		* views/shared/_Layout.mobile.cshtml
		* views/shared/_ViewSwitcher.cshtml
		* controllers/ViewSwitcherController.cs
	- Run it
		* Desktop no-change
		* Mobile emulators
			- view switcher
			- color
			- images are now displayed
			- navigate to Account/LogOn (show log on screen)
			
jQ Mobile: data- attribute
	- read slide
	- Show jQ Mobile demo buttons
	- look at data- attribute implementation
			
jQuery Mobile: Page Anatomy
	- Show doctype declaration in _layout and _layout.Mobile (html5 is the default in MVC4)
	- Show _layout.mobile for data-role elements
			
Coding Time
	- Bring up Dream Cars MVC4
	- Note it is a copy of the MVC3 app as a basic MVC4 app with jQuery.mobile.mvc installed
	- Manufacturers/Models/Engines Index
		- UL
			- data-role="listview"
			- data-filter="true"
			
	** That looks pretty good now, but let's fancy up Model and Engine
			Fancy Up Models/Engines Index from clipboard.txt
			
	- Models and Engines Details
		remove h3 table div (on top of UL)
		set colspan = td
		add data-role and data-inset to UL
		add a <li data-role="list-divider"><h3>Engines</h3></li>
